You have been supplied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for this assessment.

## Instructions

Using what you have learned in class and through the exercise, make the following additions to the main.js file.

> Take time to familiarize yourself with the existing code. It is the same code as the solution to the exercise. You are to add to the JavaScript, but you must not change the HTML or the CSS.

The logic to handle changing images in the carousel is incomplete. While it changes the images, clicking the "previous" or "next" buttons too many times causes an invalid `src` for the `<img>` element.

Your task is to ensure that the carousel properly cycles through the images both forwards and backwards. In other words, when the carousel is showing the last image in the array, clicking the "next" button will show the first image. In the same way, if the first image is shown, then clicking the "previous" button will show the last image in the array. Ensure that your code will work even if there are more than three images in the array (you can assume at least one image in the array).
