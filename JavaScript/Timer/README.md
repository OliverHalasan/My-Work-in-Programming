# In Class Assessment 5 - Working with Timers[5%]

You have been supplied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files located int the carousel-timers folder.

## Instructions

----


Do not change the HTML or CSS files in any way. Only update the supplied main.js file so that moving the mouse cursor over the image displayed will pause the slideshow and moving the mouse cursor off of the image will resume the slideshow (you must make use of the clearInterval and setInterval functions for this).


## Submission

Ensure that you have saved the changes to your repository. Then commit and push those changes to GitHub.
