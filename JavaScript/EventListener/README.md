# In Class Exercise 3 - Decisions and Forms [5%]

Using what you have learned in class and through the exercise, make the following updates to your solution:

1. The work you completed in the previous exercise still has a few holes in it.  For example, when you enter a multiple word tag (e.g. athens history) all words will be added but only the first will have the ‘#’  before it.  Update your solution so that it rejects tag values of more than one word and displays the message Tags cannot contain spaces.  This will require you to rethink how error messages are currently being displayed. Only change the main.js file. Do not change the index.html or main.css files.

Please commit and push your solution.

HINT: Research the JavaScript .indexOf function to check for spaces in between characters.
