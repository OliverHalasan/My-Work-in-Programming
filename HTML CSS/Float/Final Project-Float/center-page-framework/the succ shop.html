        <h1>Watering</h1>
        <p>
            A common misconception is that succulents don’t need very much water to survive. They in fact need enough water to <br>
             keep their leaves, stem and root full in order to withstand<br>
              periods of drought.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best way to water succulents and encourage healthy<br> 
            root growth is to completely soak the soil and allow it to dry<br> out
             completely before watering again. Lightly spraying the<br>
              soil will cause succulents to put off small thin roots which<br>
               will easily wither and die. Soaking the soil allows them to absorb the water they need. Letting the soil dry out <br>
               completely allows the succulent time to grow and put off<br>
                strong healthy roots.

        <h1>Container Gardening</h1>
        <p>Succulents are tough plants and can grow in a variety of places. For long term growing, it’s generally best to place them in a container with a drainage hole and to use<br> well-draining soil. While you can plant succulents in fun containers with no drainage such as old shoes, tea cups, votives, etc. they may not be the best long term solutions due to watering challenges. Terracotta or ceramic pots will dry out more quickly than plastic or other materials, so be sure to adjust watering accordingly. As succulents get too big for the container they are in, you can cut back the new growth and plant it elsewhere or move the whole plant to a larger container.
