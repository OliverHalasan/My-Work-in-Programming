---

## Instructions

Clone a copy of this repository to your device so that you can develop it locally. When you finish, make sure to push your latest commit to GitHub Classroom. 

For this Lab, you will create a website with several pages and a fully functional top-level navigation. In the smallest (mobile) view, the user should be able to show and hide (toggle) the navigation with the click of a button. In the largest (desktop) view, the user should be able to hover or tab over a dropdown menu. 

This Lab will be  a Code-A-Long where you are expected to put in the final touches.

## The Build Methodology

Start by writing all of your HTML. You will need a ``<header>``, followed by a ``<main>``. Inside of your ``<header>``, you'll need a first-level heading, your monkey logo, and a ``<nav>`` with three drop-down menus. These menus should be structured as follows: 

	> Products

	>> Featured

	>> Popgrips

	>> Accessories

	> Customize

	>> Create For You

	>> Create For Business

	> Sale

	>> See All 

For the remainder of the build, follow the recordings. As you work through this Lab, make sure to validate your HTML and to make commits whenever you reach a milestone in your work.
