<h2 class="list">Advanced Welding Technology</h2>

<p class="description">The Advanced Welding Technology diploma goes beyond the Alberta Welder Apprenticeship training. It combines advanced technical knowledge, welding skills, and exposure to modern technologies to give a graduate the competitive edge into a career in welding. From skills in fabrication to product innovation and inspection methods, you will gain foundational skills that are in-demand by industry. This two-year program is a direct pathway into apprenticeship trades training at NAIT without having to first be a registered apprentice. In addition, it teaches the knowledge required to be a leader in the industry.

Thanks to the growth of environmental industries, ongoing infrastructure repair and the increasing rate of retirement among existing welders, there are many career paths in this industry for graduates to explore!</p>
